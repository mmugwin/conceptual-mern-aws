# *conceptual*

Welcome to my repository for *conceptual*, a project I have been pursuing to foster mastery of foundational knowledge in tech by making learning and practice more active. 

While there is no shortage of reading material and video content on fundamental concepts online, I have found most existing content to have two main weaknesses:
- it is designed to be consumed passively either by reading or watching tech YouTubers regurgitate scripts that usually only scratch the surface of the required knowledge and, with few exceptions, are optimised to increase view count than foster your growth. The passive act of watching videos or reading creates the illusion of competence.
- it is difficult to perform quality control because anyone, regardless of their expertise, can create content on almost anything. The resulting saturation of the knowledge landscape with badly explained and poorly executed teaching makes it quite painful to learn, let alone master basic things. 

*conceptual* aims to put you in charge of your own learning. I treat this as a living notebook where all my notes are in the form of questions and answers allowing me to strengthen my knowledge through revision by active recall. I have tried to learn from the source (textbooks, lecture notes, documentation or accredited online courses) to ensure the correctness of the information.

In the future, I hope to add additional features that can allow others to use this project for their own learning.
